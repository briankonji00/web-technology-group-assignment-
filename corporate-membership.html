       <br></br>
        <p1>The 19th Hole Harare Golf Club is a highly regarded destination for golf enthusiasts in Zimbabwe and is known for its exceptional courses and facilities. The Club's strategic location in proximity to the city center and ample parking space make it an ideal location for corporate members. The Corporate Membership package offers a variety of features, which are outlined below:
        </p1>
<br></br>
        <ul>
        <li>1.Individuals seeking to become members of the Corporate Membership package must complete a membership application form, providing their relevant personal information, a copy of their national ID, and a recent passport-style photograph. Unlike regular members, Corporate members are not required to have a proposer or seconder for their application.</li>
        <br></br>
<li>2.Subscription to the Corporate Membership package covers the subscription fee, but excludes affiliation to the National body and the handicap license fee. New Corporate members joining for the first time may be required to pay a one-off joining fee, which will be communicated at the time of joining if applicable.</li>
       <br></br>
 <li>3.To become a Corporate Member, the package requires a minimum of two individuals, and there is no limit to the number of members that a corporate package can cover. Furthermore, the Corporate membership is transferable between individuals, provided there is instruction from the relevant authority within the corporate body. The membership belongs to the corporate entity rather than the individual.</li>
        <br></br>
<li>4.Individuals who no longer qualify for Corporate Membership under the program must reapply to the Club in their own capacity, including securing a proposer and seconder for their application. They will be required to pay all relevant fees and subscriptions.</li>
      <br></br> 
 <li>5.In the event that the corporate body elects to retain membership for a specific individual no longer in their employment, this is permissible under the program, on receipt of written instruction from the relevant authority within the corporate body.</li>
        <br></br>
<li>6.Corporate Membership provides full membership, allowing individuals covered under the package to play on any day of the week as long as they have booked tee-off times by calling the Club, sending an email, or booking online on the Club website.</li>
       <br></br> 
<li>7.As a benefit of Corporate Membership, the Club allocates four complimentary green fee vouchers per subscription year to each paid-up Corporate Member covered under the package. Members are entitled to bring in their guests for a pre-booked round of golf. This benefit will only be awarded on presentation of a valid voucher when checking in at the ProShop.</li>
      <br></br>  
<li>8.Corporate members are given priority when booking a Corporate Golf Day at 19th Hole, although there is no guarantee of an available date on a Friday selected by the Corporate member. Green Fees for Corporate Golf Days are determined by the time of the year that the event is held. To obtain more information on hosting a golf day at 19th Hole, interested parties can request such information from the Club.</li> 
       <br></br> 
<li>9.Each Corporate entity is entitled to a free mini-golf day on any weekday morning from Monday through Thursday for a maximum of 50 players. All other costs are for the Corporate Client. This will be pre-booked with the Club in the usual manner and is subject to available dates.</li>
       <br></br>
 <li>10.The Corporate body is issued a Bar swipe card, which may be used when entertaining staff or guests at the Club. This Bar swipe card entitles the Corporate Body to a discount on all beverages sold at the Club.
        The Corporate body can use the Club's public rooms free of charge for business-related functions, provided that they book and confirm the use of the facility beforehand. 19th Hole offers ample safe parking for guests. 
        </li>
<br></br>
        <li>11.ZOL offers 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi connection per device per day throughout the Clubhouse.</li>
<br></br>
        <li>12.Corporate clients who may like to consider sponsoring projects at the Club can negotiate membership terms and branding options with the General Manager.</li>
        <br></br>
<li>13.The Corporate body is entitled to one vote at the Annual General Meeting of the Club.</li>
